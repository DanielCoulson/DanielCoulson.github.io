I am a third-year Statistics PhD student with an interest in Bayesian statistics, time series analysis, quantitative finance, and deep learning.

My first research project focused on modeling time-varying correlation matrices in a Bayesian framework and applying this approach to portfolio risk management. Specifically, we demonstrate that portfolio diversification does not mitigate the problems caused by a financial crisis for an investor's portfolio. We also applied our methodology to construct minimum variance portfolios (MVPs) and compared them with those constructed using standard methods.

For my second project I ideated a novel problem called the ForeClassing problem which we face daily where the cost of a classification decision is observed at a future time point, after we must make the classification decision. I formalized this problem mathematically, and proved a motivating theorem, the ForeClassing theorem, to demonstrate mathematically why we should care about this problem. To solve the ForeClassing problem I proposed a novel Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet which included two novel neural network layers, Boltzmann Convolutions and Welford mean-variance variance. I then demonstrated my proposed network achieves superior performance to current state of the art methods in several simulation scenarios and two real world data sets.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Newcastle University, earning a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics with First Class Honours and an overall grade of 88.3%. I was also awarded the Reverend Gilbert Robertson Prize for academic excellence and an academic excellence scholarship.
