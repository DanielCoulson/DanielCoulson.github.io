I am a third-year Statistics PhD student with an interest in Bayesian statistics, time series analysis, quantitative finance, and deep learning. I am currently developing a novel Bayesian deep learning architecture that I designed, with preliminary results showing state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

My first research project focused on modeling time-varying correlation matrices in a Bayesian framework and applying this approach to portfolio risk management. Specifically, we demonstrate that portfolio diversification does not mitigate the problems caused by a financial crisis for an investor's portfolio. We also applied our methodology to construct minimum variance portfolios (MVPs) and compared them with those constructed using standard methods.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Newcastle University, earning a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics with First Class Honours and an overall grade of 88.3%. I was also awarded the Reverend Gilbert Robertson Prize for academic excellence and an academic excellence scholarship.
