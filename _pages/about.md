I am a Statistics PhD candidate at Cornell University. The theme of my PhD research is decision-making under uncertainty. I have particularly focused on Bayesian statistics and time-series analysis. My research has applications in several areas, including quantitative finance, Cardiology, and extreme weather, amongst others. 

I have proposed a new hierarchical Bayesian model for time-varying correlation matrices. As part of this, I established a first-of-its-kind posterior concentration result to demonstrate the model’s theoretical performance. A simulation study was also performed, demonstrating the model’s superior performance in terms of accuracy and credible interval width at the desired level of coverage, compared to competing methods. The model was applied to real-world financial markets in times of crisis, providing more responsive dynamics than the VIX index, and used to estimate minimum-variance portfolios. 

I have also proposed a new machine learning problem called the Foreclassing problem. In this problem, the class label of a time series depends on the future observations of that time series, which requires a model to first forecast the time series, possibly consider its predictive uncertainty regarding those forecasts, and then make a classification decision. I state and prove the Foreclassing Theorem, which formally characterizes when Foreclassing is more helpful relative to standard time series classification. To solve this problem, I have proposed a novel deep Bayesian neural network called ForeClassNet, including a new neural network layer called Boltzmann convolutions, which allow for a probabilistic approach to learning kernel sizes in convolutional layers. Through several experiments on real-world datasets, ForeClassNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art time-series classifiers, demonstrating the advantage of solving the Foreclassing problem and the strength of ForeClassNet. 

As part of a collaborative project with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, I developed a deep Bayesian multimodal neural network for ECG classification, which achieved superior performance in the target performance metric, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, compared with state-of-the-art competing methods, and showed strong performance for the sickest patients. 

I am also working on a project in statistical decision theory.
