I am a third year Statistics PhD student with an interest in Bayesian Statistics, Time Series Analysis, Quantitative Finace, and deep learning. I am currently working on a novel Bayesian Deep learning architecture I ideated with preliminary results showing state of the art performance on baseline datasets. 

My first research project focused on modelling time varying correlation matrices in Bayesian fashion and applying this to portfolio risk management. Particularly, we demonstrate that portfolio diversification does not avail the problems caused by a financial crisis on an investors portfolio. We also applied our methodology to constructing minimum variance portfolios (MVPs) and comparing them with the MVPs constructed by standard methods. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at Newcastle University earning a BSc Hons Mathematics and Statistics with First Class Honours with an overall grade of 88.3% and was awarded the Reverend Gilbert Robertson prize for academic excellence.
