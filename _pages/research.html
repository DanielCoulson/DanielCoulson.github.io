<h2>Deep Bayesian neural networks for Time Series Classification</h2>
<p>I am developing a novel Bayesian deep learning framework that I designed for time series classification problems. My current model is achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.</p>

<h2>Time Varying Correlation Matrices with an Application to Financial Crises</h2>
<p>In this project I developed a novel approach for modelling time varying model based correlation matrices in a Bayesian manner.</p>
