<h2>Deep Bayesian neural networks for Time Series Classification</h2>
<p>In this paper we propose a novel problem called the ForeClassing problem where the loss of a classification decision is only observed at a future time point after the classification decision has to be made. To solve this problem, we propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network architecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the time series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of occurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this, we introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and Boltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to iteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted time points for each inputted time series to the network through successive forward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned representation of the observed realizations of the time series for its classification decision. Boltzmann convolutional layers are linear combinations of approximately Bayesian convolutional layers with different filter lengths, allowing the model to learn multitemporal resolution representations of the input time series, and which resolutions to focus on within a given Boltzmann convolutional layer through a Boltzmann distribution. Both layers are novel additions to the deep learning practitioners' tool kit, which would be helpful in problems concerned with using neural networks to make decisions with sequential data regarding future events. Through several simulation scenarios and two real world applications we demonstrate ForeClassNet achieves superior performance compared with current state of the art methods including a near 30% improvement in test set accuracy in our financial example compared to the second best performing model.</p>

<h2>Time Varying Correlation Matrices with an Application to Financial Crises</h2>
<p>In this project we developed a novel approach for modelling time varying model based correlation matrices in a Bayesian manner with an application to portfolio risk management. Specifically, we demonstrate that portfolio diversification does not mitigate the problems caused by a financial crisis for an investorâ€™s portfolio. We also applied our methodology to construct minimum variance portfolios (MVPs) and compared them with those constructed using standard methods.</p>
