<h2>Boltzmann convolutions and Welford mean-variance layers with an application to time series forecasting and classification</h2>
<p>We propose a novel machine learning problem, which we call the `Foreclassing problem', where we wish to make a time series classification decision, but the loss of our decision is observed at a future time point and the true class label is dependent on the past realizations of the time series and future observations. We motivate this problem from the daily decisions humans make and through a decision theoretic theorem. We formalize the problem mathematically and propose a novel neural network architecture with two new types of neural network layers to solve it, directing our model to process information in a manner akin to human decision making, as demonstrated in the neuroscience literature. We then show how our proposed approach and architecture achieves comparable, to superior, performance when compared to existing state of the art time series classification methods through simulation studies and real-world examples.</p>

<h2>A Bayesian factor model with dynamic shrinkage for time-varying correlation matrices with an application to Financial Crises</h2>
<p>In this paper we propose a novel approach to quantifying the risk from a co-movement of stocks in a portfolio through time, derived from time varying model-based correlation matrices. The correlation matrices are estimated in a Bayesian fashion utilizing a dynamic shrinkage prior process for the state variables to be estimated and a multivariate factor stochastic volatility process for the observation error covariance matrices. To summarize the information in correlation matrices we create an intuitive and simple scalar score. Through a simulation study we demonstrate our estimation approach achieves superior performance in terms of several metrics and has an ability to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions compared to competing methods. Through real world examples we demonstrate the new insights provided by our proposed framework in identifying known periods of financial instability and the additional information it provides beyond existing measures such as the VIX index. We subsequently compare the static minimum variance portfolio to that of a dynamically changing minimum variance portfolio in times of financial crisis. Our model provides a new overall measure of correlation in a system which can be utilized by both practitioners and researchers as a tool to quantify the correlation risks in a portfolio and the degree of toxicity in the financial system.</p>
