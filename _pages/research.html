<h2>Deep Bayesian neural networks for Time Series Classification</h2>
<p>I am developing a novel Bayesian deep learning framework which I ideated for time series classification problems.My work current model is achieving state of the art performance on baseline datsets. </p>

<h2>Time Varying Correlation Matrices with an Application to Financial Crises</h2>
<p>In this project I developed a novel approach for modelling time varying model based correlation matrices in a Bayesian manner.</p>
