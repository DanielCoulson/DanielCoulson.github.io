<h2>Deep Bayesian neural networks for Time Series Classification</h2>
<p>I am developing a novel Bayesian deep learning framework that I have designed for time series classification. My current model is achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.</p>

<h2>Time Varying Correlation Matrices with an Application to Financial Crises</h2>
<p>In this project we developed a novel approach for modelling time varying model based correlation matrices in a Bayesian manner with an application to portfolio risk management. Specifically, we demonstrate that portfolio diversification does not mitigate the problems caused by a financial crisis for an investorâ€™s portfolio. We also applied our methodology to construct minimum variance portfolios (MVPs) and compared them with those constructed using standard methods.</p>
