<h2>BTRY 6010 Statistical Methods I</h2>
<p>I have been a teaching assistant (TA) for BTRY 6010 in each fall semester starting in 2022. This is an introductory statistics class for graduate students. My duties for this course include teaching weekly lab sessions to 40+ students, where I demonstrate how to implement statistical techniques using the R programming language, holding weekly office hours, grading assessments, and writing exam questions. In this course we teach a wide variety of statistical techniques including hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and linear regression models.   </p>

<h2>BTRY 6020 Statistical Methods II</h2>
<p>I have been a TA for BTRY 6010 in each spring semester starting in 2023. This is the second course in a two course sequence of introductory statistics courses for graduate students. My duties are the same as for BTRY 6010. In this class the students build upon the material from BTRY 6010 with topics including multiple linear regression, ANCOVA, and introductory causal inference.</p>
