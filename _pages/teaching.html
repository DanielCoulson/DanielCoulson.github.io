<h2>BTRY 6010 Statistical Methods I</h2>
<p>I have served as a teaching assistant (TA) for BTRY 6010 every fall semester since 2022. This is an introductory statistics course for graduate students.My responsibilities for this course include teaching weekly lab sessions to over 40 students, where I demonstrate statistical techniques using the R programming language, holding weekly office hours, grading assignments, and writing exam questions. In this course, we teach a wide variety of statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and linear regression models. </p>

<h2>BTRY 6020 Statistical Methods II</h2>
<p>I have been a TA for BTRY 6020 every spring semester since 2023. This is the second course in a two-course sequence of introductory statistics courses for graduate students. My responsibilities are the same as those for BTRY 6010. In this class, students build upon the material from BTRY 6010, covering topics such as multiple linear regression, ANCOVA, and introductory causal inference.</p>
