I'm currently working on developing **Deep Bayesian Neural Networks** for time series classification. This research aims to build models that not only classify time series data but also quantify uncertainty in predictions, which is crucial for applications requiring dependable decision-making.

The goal is to improve classification accuracy in scenarios with limited data and develop methods for effective uncertainty estimation. Future directions include extending this approach to multi-dimensional time series data and comparing its performance against conventional neural networks in real-world applications.
